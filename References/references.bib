  abstract="Linear dimensionality reduction methods, such as LDA, are often used in object recognition for feature extraction, but do not address the problem of how to use these features for recognition. In this paper, we propose Probabilistic LDA, a generative probability model with which we can both extract the features and combine them for recognition. The latent variables of PLDA represent both the class of the object and the view of the object within a class. By making examples of the same class share the class variable, we show how to train PLDA and use it for recognition on previously unseen classes. The usual LDA features are derived as a result of training PLDA, but in addition have a probability model attached to them, which automatically gives more weight to the more discriminative features. With PLDA, we can build a model of a previously unseen class from a single example, and can combine multiple examples for a better representation of the class. We show applications to classification, hypothesis testing, class inference, and clustering, on classes not observed during training.",

  abstract = "In the domain of speaker recognition, many methods have been proposed over time. The technology for automatic speaker recognition has now reached a good level of performance but there is still need of improvement. In this paper, a new low-dimensional speaker- and channel-dependent space is defined using a simple factor analysis also known as i-vector. This space is named the total variability space because it models both speaker and channel variabilities. The i-vector subspace modelling is one of the recent methods that have become the state of the art technique in this domain. This method largely provides the benefit of modelling both the intra-domain and inter-domain variabilities into the same low dimensional space. In this study, 2656 syllables bio-acoustic signals from 55 species of frog taken from Intelligent Biometric Group, USM database are used for frog identification system. Parameters of the system are initially tuned such as Universal Background Model (UBM) size (32, 64 and 128 Gaussians) and i-vector dimensionality (100, 200 and 400 dimensions). To the end, we assess the effect of the parameter tuned and record the computation time. We observed that, the accuracy for smaller UBM size and higher i-vector dimensionality outperforms others with result of 91.11% is achieved. From this research, it can be concluded that UBM size and i-vector dimensionality effect the accuracy of frog identification based on i-vector."

  abstract = "Reynolds, Douglas A., Quatieri, Thomas F., and Dunn, Robert B., Speaker Verification Using Adapted Gaussian Mixture Models, Digital Signal Processing10(2000), 19–41. In this paper we describe the major elements of MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based speaker verification system used successfully in several NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluations (SREs). The system is built around the likelihood ratio test for verification, using simple but effective GMMs for likelihood functions, a universal background model (UBM) for alternative speaker representation, and a form of Bayesian adaptation to derive speaker models from the UBM. The development and use of a handset detector and score normalization to greatly improve verification performance is also described and discussed. Finally, representative performance benchmarks and system behavior experiments on NIST SRE corpora are presented."
